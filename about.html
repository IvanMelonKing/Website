    i went 5 years in kindergarden - 7 years in kidschool - 3 years in teenschool - 2 years on highschool ITM first year and IT second year. <br>
    my intress of coding started when i watch a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Danidev">Dani</a>, 
    and realy wanted to do something simular, and thats why i went 1 year ITM and 1 year IT <br>
    4th of november i started to learn German, i started using duolingo for like a month, 
    and then stoped using it and tried other methods like Longodeer and flashcards, 
    when i treid using lingodeer i had issues and didnt wanna pay. And with flashcards i found it annoying so i stoped. <br>
