        <h2>History of Ivan</h2>
        <p>
            I was born on December 20th, 2005, in Bergen. I started playing games for as long as I can remember. 
            I attended kindergarten for 5 years, elementary school for 7 years, middle school for 3 years, and then high schoolâ€”ITM for the first year and IT for the second year.
            My interest in coding began after watching a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Danidev">Dani</a>, which inspired me to pursue something similar. 
            I spent 1 year at ITM and 1 year at IT.

            On November 4th, I began learning German. Initially, I used Duolingo for a month, then switched to other methods like LingoDeer and flashcards. 
            Duolingo was problematic, and I didn't want to pay for it. Flashcards were also inconvenient, so I stopped. I might pick it up again.
            I am fluent in Norwegian and English and currently learning German.
